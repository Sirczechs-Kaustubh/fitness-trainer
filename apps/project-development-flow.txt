🚀 Project FormFit – Development Workflow & Phases

🔹 Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundations
Goal: Get the skeleton of the app running, with both frontend and backend integrated.
Tasks:
Initialize monorepo structure (apps/api, apps/web) with shared ESLint/Prettier configs.


Backend setup:


Install express, mongoose, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, socket.io.


Setup app.js & index.js with basic routes.


Connect MongoDB (test schema with User).


Frontend setup:


Install next, tailwindcss, axios, socket.io-client, chart.js.


Setup layout + global styles.


Connect frontend → backend with a test API call (/ping).


✅ Deliverable: “Hello World” backend + frontend with working API and DB connection.

🔹 Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
Goal: Make sure users can register, login, and manage profiles securely.
Backend (apps/api):
auth.routes.js → register, login, logout, reset password.


JWT middleware (auth.middleware.js).


Password hashing (bcrypt).


User model: { name, email, password, age, weight, height, fitnessGoals }.


Frontend (apps/web):
Pages: /register, /login, /profile.


Hook: useAuth.js for token management (localStorage).


Protect routes (dashboard requires login).


✅ Deliverable: Full login system with JWT & protected pages.

🔹 Phase 3: Dashboard & User Stats
Goal: Give the user a central hub for fitness data.
Backend:
API: /user/stats (pull BMI, progress, reminders).


/workouts/history → return logs.


Frontend:
Dashboard page:


Welcome message (user.name).


BMI calculator.


Charts: weekly/monthly progress using Chart.js.


Quick “Start Workout” button.


✅ Deliverable: Personalized dashboard with analytics.

🔹 Phase 4: Exercise Library (8 Core Exercises)
Goal: Implement MediaPipe Pose detection and integrate each exercise with rules.
Backend (exercise definitions):
Create Exercise.model.js with:

 { name, description, anglesTracked, rules }


Store 8 exercises with metadata.


Frontend:
Page: /exercises → list of exercises.


Individual exercise pages with:


Live camera feed (MediaPipe).


Form instructions.


Overlay for detected skeleton.


Feedback text + rep counter.


✅ Deliverable: Each of the 8 exercises detectable with real-time overlay + rep tracking.

🔹 Phase 5: Real-time Pose Detection & Feedback
Goal: Bring in real-time interactivity with Socket.IO & WebRTC.
Backend:
WebSocket rules engine (in websocket/rules/).


Real-time communication for:


Rep counting updates.


Audio/text feedback.


Performance scoring.


Frontend:
WebRTC integration for smooth camera streaming.


Socket.io client listens for backend feedback.


Visual overlays (color-coded: green = good, red = fix posture).


Audio cues for corrections.


✅ Deliverable: Real-time feedback loop (<100ms latency).

🔹 Phase 6: Workout Sessions
Goal: Make structured workouts possible.
Backend:
API: /workouts/start, /workouts/end.


Store sessions in DB: { userId, date, exercises, reps, score }.


Frontend:
Workout builder (select exercises + reps/sets).


Session view:


Timer (exercise/rest periods).


Live rep counter.


Post-workout summary with score + calories burned.


✅ Deliverable: Users can run full workouts, tracked & saved.

🔹 Phase 7: Analytics & Progress Tracking
Goal: Visualize progress in detail.
Backend:
/progress API → fetch weekly/monthly stats.


Metrics: calories burned, reps done, best score, accuracy trend.


Frontend:
Chart.js visualizations:


Line graph → form accuracy.


Bar chart → calories per week.


Heatmap → workout frequency.


✅ Deliverable: Interactive analytics dashboard.

🔹 Phase 8: Workout History & Data Management
Goal: Give users historical context of their performance.
Backend:
/workouts/history → returns past sessions.


Optional: upload video recordings for review.


Frontend:
History page:


List of past sessions.


Expand to view exercise-by-exercise performance.


Export to CSV/JSON.


✅ Deliverable: Rich workout history with export.

🔹 Phase 9: Demo & Tutorial Section
Goal: Educate users with interactive guides.
Frontend:
Demo mode for each exercise:


Animated MediaPipe avatar.


Correct vs incorrect form side-by-side.


Camera calibration tool before starting workouts.


✅ Deliverable: Fully guided tutorials for first-time users.

🔹 Phase 10: Security & Optimization
Goal: Make the app production-ready.
Security:
Helmet.js headers.


Input sanitization.


Rate limiting for APIs.


Strong JWT implementation.


Optimization:
Lazy load components.


WebGL acceleration for MediaPipe.


IndexedDB/local caching for offline support.


✅ Deliverable: Stable, secure, optimized final app.

🔄 Project Workflow (Reference)
Here’s the efficient workflow for dev & delivery:
Setup & Config → Initialize repo, backend & frontend skeleton.


Authentication First → Users can login/register securely.


Dashboard Basics → Core user experience before workouts.


Exercise Library → Core AI feature (pose detection).


Real-time Feedback → Add Socket.IO + WebRTC interactivity.


Workout Sessions → Make training structured & trackable.


Analytics & History → Long-term value (charts, trends).


Demo & Tutorials → Educate users for retention.


Security & Optimization → Harden before release.


Final QA & Deployment → Push to production.
